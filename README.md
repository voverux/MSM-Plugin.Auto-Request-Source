# MSM Auto Request Source Plugin

This MSM plugin controls Request Source field value. If it's not set by the system (surprisingly, but left empty) then plugin sets its value to the one specified in the plugin configuration.
Please feel free to contact Marval Baltic if you would like to see it working.

## Compatible Versions

## Installation

## Configuration

Once the plugin has been installed as plugin parameters you need to specify:
